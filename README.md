# MPR Viewer

The **MPR Viewer** is a powerful tool for visualizing and analyzing 3D medical imaging data. It supports Multiplanar Reconstruction (MPR), allowing users to view medical images in three orthogonal planes: Axial, Coronal, and Sagittal. With interactive features such as zoom, rotate, and pan, this viewer is designed for medical professionals and researchers to examine 3D datasets with precision.

## Features

- **Multiplanar Reconstruction (MPR)**: View medical images in three orthogonal planes (Axial, Coronal, and Sagittal) for detailed analysis.
- **Interactive Controls**: Rotate, zoom, and pan through the 3D data to explore every angle and section.
- **Customizable Viewports**: Adjust the layout of the MPR viewports to suit your visualization needs.
- **Image Slicing**: Slice through volumetric data to inspect internal structures, offering more insights into the anatomy.
